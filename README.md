# KoolCatz

is my attempt to fulfill a responsive web for the Code Academy assignment Responsive Club (CSS).

I struggled a bit with the @media sections and with the events section. My takeaway from this excercise is that all images should be sized accordingly to the design in order to make life easier. 

I am quite proud with how the menu turned out, without having to use JS. 

Hope you like it.
